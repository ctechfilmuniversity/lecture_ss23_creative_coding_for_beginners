## This Course

You might think that for doing cool, e.g. visual stuff with coding you need mountains of coding knowledge. That is not true. Even a with a beginners skill level you can do nice things.

Look for example at these different possibilities to do visual designs and even art with just an arrangement of circles!

### Learning Objectives

With this course, you will gain

* an understanding of programming,
* **skills to develop simple programs from scratch**,
    * Knowledge about resources
    * Guidance towards and learning through self-studies,
* skills to apply programming as (an expressive) tool.

### Topics

Class topics can be divided into what you learn about programming itself and its *syntax* and what you do with your newly developed programming skill, meaning its application.

In regard to programming itself, we will cover:

* Commands, variables
* Events
* Conditions
* Loops
* Arrays
* Functions

We apply these programming skills to implement:
