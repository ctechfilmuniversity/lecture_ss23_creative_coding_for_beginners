## Task 06.01 - Algorithmic Thinking

Getting dressed is an example of an algorithm. Everyone makes a set of decisions based on the weather, where to go that day, day of the week, and their personal style to choose their outfits. 

Write down an algorithm (e.g., in pseudo code or as bullet points; a drawing could also be helpful to visualize the steps as decision tree) for how you decide on which top, bottom and shoes you wear.

*Submission*: Your algorithm as text or image in your OwnCloud file.

## Task 06.02 - Images - NOT READY YET

* Re-cap [Script 09 - Images](../../02_scripts/ccfb_ss23_09_images_script.md).

## Task 06.02 - Image Manipulation

Write a program that manipulates an image. I recommend that you first further investigate the [image object](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Image) and [possible functions](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Image) in the reference. Also, feel free to use the code from the lecture as basis.

*Submission*: Add a link to your sketch in your OwnCloud file.

*Happy Imaging!*
