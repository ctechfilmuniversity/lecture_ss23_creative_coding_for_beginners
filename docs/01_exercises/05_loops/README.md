## Task 05.01 - Loops & Catching Up

* Carefully read [Script 08 - Loops](../../02_scripts/ccfb_ss23_08_loops_script.md) and try to understand loops as good as you can.
* Also review all topics 

## Task 05.02 - A Grid Pattern

Write a sketch that generates a pattern with a similar logic as the 10 PRINT example. You can use the code from the script as basis. Ideally, your pattern should follow an element-by-element and row-by-row iterative creation process - but don't feel limited be this. If you have other ideas for creating a pattern, go for it! The overall goal is to create a visual pleasing or interesting pattern up to your liking.  

Here an example:

*Submission*: Add a link to your sketch in your OwnCloud file.

#### Task 05.03 - Interactive Parameters

Make your pattern interactive by mapping at least one changeable visual characteristics to, e.g., the mouse and / or keys.

*Submission*: Add a link to your sketch in your OwnCloud file.

*Happy Looping!*
