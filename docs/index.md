This course offers a basic introduction to programming with focus on graphics, sound and interaction. The programming framework is p5. Students gain fundamental programming skills and reflect on the usage of software in a creative context.

## Learning Objectives

With this course, you will gain

* an understanding of programming,
* **skills to develop simple programs from scratch**,
    * Knowledge about resources
    * Guidance towards and learning through self-studies,
* skills to apply programming as (an expressive) tool.

## Topics

Class topics can be divided into what you learn about programming itself and its *syntax* and what you do with your newly developed programming skill, meaning its application.

In regard to programming itself, we will cover:

* Commands, variables
* Events
* Conditions
* Loops
* Arrays
* Functions

We apply these programming skills to implement:

* Drawing, colors
* Interaction
* Movement / Animation
* Image, video
* Sound
  

Please note that topics are subject to change during the course!
